Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Vehicle_length, vehicle_weight and ground_clearance are deemed significant factors based on the p-value established.  
  When these measures go up, vehicle MPG goes down. This a negative relational correlation. 
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  The slope is Intercept and cannot be considered zero.  According to multipl regression models p-value is smaller than .05 the significance level.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  It does an adequate job predicting. Multiple r-squared .7149 or 71% of the time, these variables are able to predict mpg values correctly.
